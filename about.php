            <p>We are a Ferris State University Student Organization known as the Makers of Engaging Games and Animations.</p>
            <p>We provide students opportunities to study art, design, the development of games, animation, and cinema. Part of that includes hosting this very website, megaworks!</p>
            <p>Megaworks is a central hub for students to show off their projects and to keep up with club news all in one central hub.</p>
